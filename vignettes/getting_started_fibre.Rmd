```{r setup}

We start with a phylogeny and some traits we want to model. `{fibre}` uses the `{phyf}` package to keep a phylogeny stored in the phylogenetic flow (`pf`) format along with the data. We will load a premade `pf` object for this example, but later we will see how to make your own `pf` object from a phylogeny stored in as an `ape::phylo` object.

```{r load_data}
avonet
```
