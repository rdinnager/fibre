```{r setup}

library(fibre)

```

We start with a phylogeny and some traits we want to model. `{fibre}` uses the `{phyf}` package to keep a phylogeny stored in the phylogenetic flow (`pf`) format along with the data. We will load a premade `pf` object for this example, but later we will see how to make your own `pf` object from a phylogeny stored in as an `ape::phylo` object.

```{r load_data}
vert_bmr
```
```{r scale}
vert_bmr <- vert_bmr %>%
  mutate(phlo = pf_scale_flow_sum(phlo))
```

```{r test_mold}
test <- fibre(lnBMR + lnGS ~ lnMass + endo + bre(phlo) + bre(phlo^2, latent = 2), data = vert_bmr)
```
