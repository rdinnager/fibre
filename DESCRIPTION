Description: Implements Phylogenetic Branch Regression models which allow for flexible and versatile models
  of evolution along a phylogeny. The model can be used to detect shifts in rates of evolution along
  branches. The model uses a continuous and linear model structure and so can be easily combined
  with other non-phylogenetic statistical structures, as long as they are implemented using the R
  package INLA. One major uses of this are to condition on phylogeny in a standard regression between
  two traits, thus 'accounting' for phylogenetic structure in the response variable, similar to how
  pgls is used but allowing for a more flexible phylogenetic model. This also allows the phylogenetic
  model to be combined with the spatial models that INLA excels at (and with comparable flexibility 
  to those spatial models).
